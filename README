WHERE ITS FOR::
This Programm should only give out which Modules you need, so you can take them in rc.conf (this is Arch Linux spezific...)and set to MOD_AUTOLOAD="no".
If you have any questions,improvments or problems please contact me under battleman2004[at]gmail.com


HOW IT WORKS::
Its just make "hwdetect --modules > module.txt" and "mkinitcpio -M > module.txt" and "lsmod"
then parse it out of the files delete the files save it under Uniqe-Mudules.txt set rights to 777 and its done.
Its very dirty coded because im running out of time and since 2 years nerver coded a line ruby so...

HOW TO USE IT::
Just type "ruby Uniqe.rb" thats it.
You have to be root and you need the programms mkinitcpio, hwdetect, lsmod thats it.
